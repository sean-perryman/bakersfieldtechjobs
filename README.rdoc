BakersfieldTechJobs.com

This was something I was working on to aggregate tech job postings in Bakersfield, CA. 
I ran into some issues with hosting the app on Heroku and using FlyingSphinx. 
I've since learned a great deal about deploying a rails app to an inexpensive VPS,
so it is quite possible I'll pick this project back up and continue on with it.
